Q8)In part (a)tr=2 is given and in (b) part we can calculate tr= 2.2/sqrt(a0+b0*Umax/emax)=1.625
 We have used tr calculated in (b) part in our code. It can be replaced by tr=2 for part (a)
 From the plot it can be seen that input just saturates when a step of size of 1 meter is placed on z^r
 and it can be seen from plot of step response saturation does not occur for a 1 meter step input for the new control gains.
Moreover, for part a) F_max = 5N which is harshed and for part b) F_max = 6N
